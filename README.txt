# Customer Feedback Sentiment Analysis

This project explores and analyzes customer feedback from multiple platforms (Twitter, Yelp, IMDb, etc.) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful insights and guide business improvements.

## Project Highlights

- Cleaned and preprocessed customer reviews
- Performed sentiment classification (Positive/Negative)
- Analyzed confidence levels and platform-wise trends
- Extracted top keywords and negative sentiment drivers
- Applied topic modeling (NMF with TF-IDF) to group feedback into themes
- Visualized trends through bar charts, word clouds, and summary tables

## Key Insights
- E-commerce and food delivery services received higher negative sentiment
- Service-related complaints were the dominant negative theme
- Positive sentiment was more common in product appreciation and entertainment
- Business hours showed peak user activity

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- NLP (NLTK, Scikit-learn TF-IDF, NMF)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, WordCloud)
- Google Colab

## Dataset ( From Kaggle )

- `sentiment-analysis.csv` (Synthetic dataset of 76 rows)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repo
2. Run the `Customer_feedback.ipynb` notebook
3. All results and visualizations will be generated in the notebook

## Final Outcome

A data-driven summary of customer sentiment, top negative drivers, and platform-specific pain points that can directly inform service and product improvements.
